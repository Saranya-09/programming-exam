#NUCLEOTIDE ANALYSIS

This Python script is designed to process RNA sequences, convert them into DNA sequences, and analyze the frequency and percentage of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide sequences within RNA. The script identifies significant differences in nucleotide percentages between two RNA sequences, focusing on differences that are threefold or greater.
